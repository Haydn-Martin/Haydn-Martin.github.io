These views are my own. They do not necessarily reflect any views of my current, previous,
or future employers. They do not necessarily reflect anything that is going on or has
gone on at these companies.

Views are my own. They are sometimes badly-researched and sloppy. They are sometimes
just straight-up incorrect.

And then also sometimes the english is shoddy. I make grammatical errors I make spalling
mistakes, I do things in the name of "creativity" that don't work and come off
as self-involved and snarky.

Some parts lack rigour. References are missing. Sources aren't original.
Calculations are performed exactly once and assumed to be correct.
